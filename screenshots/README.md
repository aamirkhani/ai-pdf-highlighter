# Screenshots

To complete the README, add these screenshot files:

1. `before.png` - Screenshot of original PDF (first page of Vision Transformer paper)
2. `after.png` - Screenshot of the same page after multi-color highlighting

## How to create screenshots:

1. Open `paper.pdf` in a PDF viewer, take screenshot of first page → save as `before.png`
2. Open `final_test.pdf` (or any highlighted version) in PDF viewer, take screenshot of same page → save as `after.png`

The screenshots will automatically appear in the README once you add these files and push to GitHub.
